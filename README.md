# Cabal Minimal
The default layout of Battlescribe's Cabal-Sheets is quite spacious and easily takes 4-6 pages to print. This stylesheet tries to compress that a little.

This work is heavily influenced by DaeronAlagos' killteam stylesheet, which [can be found here](https://github.com/DaeronAlagos/battlescribe-stylesheets-wh40k).
